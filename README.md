# About The Project
This project was developed during the second year of our Software Engineering degree. Its primary aim was to strengthen our understanding of programming principles and design patterns. The project focused on equipping students with the ability to identify and eliminate code smells and write cleaner and more maintainable code.

The project resulted in a computer graphics framework where you can create shapes, add lighting effects, and apply different material textures to objects. We used ray casting to see how rays interact with objects, added anti-aliasing for smoother images, and implemented threads and adaptive ray casting to speed up performance.  
# Installation guide
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

- #### Download IntelliJ IDEA
  Download and install IntelliJ IDEA from [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).
- ### Install JDK and JUnit 5.8.1
  Make sure you have JDK (Java Development Kit) installed on your machine. You can download it from [here](https://adoptopenjdk.net/).
  Additionally, ensure that JUnit 5.8.1 is set up for testing. The framework will prompt you to download the relevant JUnit version required for the project when you open it.
# View our images

Before you start creating a new scene, we recommend checking out the [images folder](./images). It contains pictures we've created, which can serve as inspiration for your work.

Here’s an example:
